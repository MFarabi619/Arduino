## Scripts 

This folder contains a bash script that I wrote from scratch to automate the process of creating a new project folder with boilerplate files.

## Features

- Asks you what you want to name your project.
- Asks if you want an LCD display for your project.
- Creates a new project folder in the 'Projects' directory.
- Creates a README.md file with the project name, and with the conditional LCD component.
- Makes a copy of a Fritzing file with the project name. The LCD and breadboard inclusion depend on the your choice.
- Provides the option to delete the folder if you wish to start over.
