## Components:
- 1 x Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- 1 x HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor
- 

## Features:
- 

## Learning Log:
- Upon receiving power, the sensor will take 1 minute to calibrate. During this time, the sensor will be very sensitive to motion and will trigger the output pin. This is normal and should be expected.
- The sensor has a range of 7 meters and a detection angle of 110 degrees.
