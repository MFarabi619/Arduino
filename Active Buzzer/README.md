## Components:
- 1 x Arduino Mega 2560 R3
- 1 x Active Buzzer
- 1 x 10K Potentiometer
- 1 x 5 mm LED
- 1 330Î© Resistor
- 5 x Male-Male wires

## Features:
- Blinking LED to provide visual indication of buzzer beeping
- Buzzer beep delay can be controlled by potentiometer


## Learning Log:
- With an active buzzer, only the duration of the tone can be changed, not the pitch.
- Compared to a passive buzzer, an active buzzer can operate on DC signals, whereas the passive buzzer requires AC signals. However the passive buzzer's tone pitch can be changed using the provided AC signals.
